# **Challenge 2: SikoMode**

## Basic Static Analysis

### Objective


The main goal of this analysis is to understand the behavior of the SikoMode malware using both basic static and basic dynamic analysis within a controlled sandbox environment. We will observe how the malware behaves under different conditions, including with and without simulated internet access, to identify its actions and extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). This approach aims to focus on how the malware works and offer practical ways to spot and deal with it
